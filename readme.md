### Data Analysis

In this course from freeCodeCamp, I assimilated good foundational hands-on knowledge of Python specialized in the field of DA. Instead of using Replit - and in the interest of time/location - I built, run, debugged my main.py files and validate these against their unit tests using VS Code in my local machine.

Sleep health and lifestyle](https://jovian.com/g-blandugar/course-project-exploratory-data-analysis-03aug2023)**

As part of Jovian's Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas course project, I performed some graphical analysis as well as inferred some preliminary trends about physical activity, heart conditions, stress levels and sleeping habbits.

In this repository, I responded to the questions of the study cases of the course 8 week SQL challenge by Danny Ma. From essential SQL syntaxis to the elaboration of more intricate structures compound by CTEs, window functions and recursive queries, these challenges were a splendid way to solidify the hands-on core knowledge in SQL.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase some examples of web scraping I created. Some of its best and preferable practices are also detailed along the narration of the markdown file.

### Data Engineering


<img align="left" width="145" height="105" src="https://github.com/GBlanch/Portfolio/blob/main/assets/GCP_Mage.png"> **[GCP Uber end-to-end pipeline](https://github.com/GBlanch/GCP-Uber-Data-Engineering-project)**

 In this project, I designed and detailed the core stages of an end-to-end data pipeline using Google Cloud Platforms as the main resource/service provider. The orchestration of the ETL process is executed with Mage

<img align="left" width="145" height="105" src="https://github.com/GBlanch/Portfolio/blob/main/assets/Azure.png"> **[Azure Tokyo Olympics end-to-end pipeline](https://github.com/GBlanch/Azure-Tokyo-Olympics-Data-Engineering-project)**

 In this project, I designed and detailed the core stages of an end-to-end data pipeline using Google Cloud Platforms as the main resource/service provider. The orchestration of the ETL process is executed with Mage

#


### Data Science

<img align="left" width="145" height="105" src="https://github.com/GBlanch/Portfolio/blob/main/assets/wqu.png"> **[WorldQuant University Applied DS Lab projects](https://github.com/GBlanch/WorldQuant-University-Applied-DS-Lab/tree/main)**

In this repo, I summarized the syllabus of the hands-on courses in Data Science I took at WQU. Due to the Copyright Licenses and Policies of WQU, no piece of IDE content/code ran or deployed in any course is permitted to be published.</p>

 In this repo, I delve into some of the core concepts of Statistics and Probability I took during my Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering. Without that essential knowledge, it would have been tougher to catch up with the most common methodologies utilized in Data Science and Machine Learning. </p>
