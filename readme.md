Sleep health and lifestyle](https://jovian.com/g-blandugar/course-project-exploratory-data-analysis-03aug2023)**

In this course project, I have performed basic Exploratory Data Analysis on sleeping and lifestyle habbits. 
Many of the essential funcions and methods of _Pandas_ and _NumPy_ are shown here, as well as the fundamental plot functions within the _Matplotlib_ and _Seaborn_ libraries for Python.

In this repository, I responded to the posed questions in some of the study cases of the course "8 week SQL challenge" by Danny Ma (Data with Danny).
From main and basic SQL syntaxis to the elaboration of more complex structures, design of CTEs and utilization of built-in functions, these series of mini-cases were a well disposed  - and yet great  - way  to review the essential knowledge of SQL.

As part of the ETL process, web scraping can play an important role to obtain the right information at the extracting stage. 
In this repository, I will showcase some of these cases using mainly the Python library _BeautifulSoup_ to parse the data mainly from HTML and XML.
